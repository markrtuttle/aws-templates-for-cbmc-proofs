This directory contains docker files for building cbmc inside a docker
container for various operating systems.

* The Dockerfile builds a container with
	* A CBMC installation: CBMC is intalled in the operating system's
	  equivalent of /usr/local/bin
	* A CBMC tarball: CBMC binaries are packaged into a tarball in the
	  operating system's equivalent of /tmp/cbmc.tar.gz.

* The Makefile contains two targs:
    * make container (the default) builds the container
	* make tarball mounts the container and extracts the tarball to the
	  current working directory
